vdt-build is used to create new native packages for the VDT infrastructure.

It is modelled on Fedora's fedpkg; the ultimate goal is to provide a friendly
interface for contributors to the OSG-Software effort.

It is currently very new; expect much code churn and rewrites in the future.

Tarball was created using the following commands:

svn co https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/native3 vdt_native
cd vdt_native
tar --exclude '.svn' -zcf vdt-build-0.0.1.tar.gz vdt-build RPM/
