This is mostly a pass-through of the EMI build.  Notes:

1.  I removed Oracle support and dependencies.  I noticed they re-distributed one of the Oracle JARs, which might actually be illegal for us to do; not sure, but don't want to risk it.
2.  Haven't figured out the exact EMI maven environment; they don't use jpackage though.  I had to patch some of the XML files to match the versions of the deps in jpackage.
3.  There are some files that needed to be chmod'd; this seems to be simply an error in their SRPM.
